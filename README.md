# Installation

Install this game with Eclipse update site. (binaries will be available soon)

PlayWithSirius requires Sirius 4.1.

To simplify installation, use Obeo Designer Community Edition 9.1 bundle as it is open source and already includes everything required to operate PlayWithSirius. 

# Development

VSM project (.odesign project) is still in workspace mode. So, install it in the same runtime than the sample.
